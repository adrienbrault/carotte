I want to make a webpage that fills a spreadsheet using a text context supplied by url hash.
Either you open that page and copy data/text, or you can use a bookmarklet to provide the context scraping the page it is invoked from.
You would define the spreadsheet columns. Name them but also be able to specify types/description/instructions.
As you update the configuration, the spreadsheet content updates progressively using
instructor php partial/stream support.
